# GoLearn
Project that aims to keep me in check (bad idea) by asking if I'm doing something productive.
Store this data with timestamps in a sqlite db using gorm. Maybe one day it'll be useful.

Really it's just an excuse to learn Go.

Requires libnotify to be installed, and a notification server that will receive the notifications.
